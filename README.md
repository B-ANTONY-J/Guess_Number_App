# Guess_Number_App
## When the player starts the game, a random number will be generated. This random number will be the number that the player will try to guess (so don’t tell the player what this number is).

# The player will then be prompted to “Pick a number between 1 and 100”. The range from 1 to 100 is inclusive, so the number can be 1, or 100 or any number in-between.

# If the number chosen is outside of this range, then an error message should be displayed saying “Your guess is not between 1 and 100, please try again”. Note: an invalid input should not affect the number of # guesses the player has left (so do not remove a guess from the player if they enter a number outside of the 1 - 100 range)

# 1.       “Please pick a higher number” (if the number they chose is lower than the randomly generated number), or


# 2.       “Please pick a lower number” (if the number they chose is higher than the randomly generated number), or


# 3.       “You win!” (if they guess the correct number)

# 4. (OPTIONAL ADD BY CODE) 4. "You're 10 points Lower than the cpu generator!"

# 5. (OPTIONAL ADD BY CODE) 5. "You're 10 points Higher than the cpu generator!"
